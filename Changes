Version 0.74-0

*  Added Rbigpost.cgi which handles POST submissions by redirecting the input to the .cgi script
   directly to the R session so that it can be read there. 
   This avoids exceeding shell limits for large data submissions

*  The package reads the submission from standard input if it is not provided by the FORM_DATA 
    environment variable, or any WWW_ variables. This is how Rbigpost.cgi hands the submission
    to R.  There is no change for the script writer to deal with - the formData variable is 
    merely constructed automatically in a different way.

Version 0.73-0

*  Identify the contents of file uploads with a class "FileUploadContent"

*  Don't collapse duplicate parameter values that correspond to file uploads
   in MultiPartFormData objects.

*  $ operator for MultiPartFormData extended to handle the case of multiple
   elements for the same parameter, specifically file uploads.

*  Added parameters to some functions to allow caller to specify content 
   of the submitted form that is usually provide via environment variables or standard 
   in.  This facilitates debugging.

Version 0.72-2

*  Deal  with repeated parameters.


****************************

*  Handle multipart/form-data which is used in POST forms when the
   contents of files are uploaded in the query.  This uses the parser for
   this type of data and also a fix/change to the R.cgi script so that
   the input on stdin is collected into FORM_DATA.  
   Note:  This version doesn't handle the different encodings of the the
   contents yet.

*  R.cgi treats the POST method by taking the input from standard input
   rather than the first command line argument ($1).  This handles both
   regular and multipart form POSTs.

*  Allow graphDir and graphURLroot to be specified as arguments
   to webPNG() and img() respectively to override or avoid
   the corresponding global variables.

*  Examples for simulations/bootstraps for the different types of form
   submission methods.

*  Using a NAMESPACE file. 

*  Will use GDD rather than ghostview (gs) if that package is available.

*  Added functionality in cgi.R to allow the developer of the script more
   control over the output. The only issue here is whether the R script
   should be able emit the Content-type line that is currently emitted by
   the R.cgi script.  If the output from the script starts with the
   string "Content-type: ", then R.cgi does not emit its version.
   This allows the user, for example, to return a data set as
   regular text by writing

   Content-type: text/plain

   and then the regular output.
   We could also use a hidden field in the form with a particular pattern
   to determine whether to output the headers.

*  HTMLheader() takes a title and css argument to add references to Cascading
   Style Sheets and insert a TITLE element. It also outputs the 
   <HTML><HEAD>.. </HEAD><BODY> tags. The endHTML() closes the BODY and HTML
   elements.

*  The img() function now returns the location of the file created by combining
   graphURLroot with the name of the file.

*  Some simple functions for add information about the request to the output of the
   script.

Incompatible changes:
____________________


Combine duplicate parameters in the query into a single character
vector, e.g.  x=1&x=2&y=3 yields list(x=c("1", "2"), y = "3"), rather
than requiring the unclass(formData)[names(formData) == "x"].  So the
resulting formData() list can now have elements that are not simple
scalar strings.

If you need (or want) the previous behavior, use the command

    R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--enable-old-style-formdata' CGIwithR

i.e. with the --enable-old-style-formdata flag for the configure script.


Other suggestions:
 Have functions return the data they construct, e.g. img() return the 
 value of the src field rather than the less useful "image" string.
 Perhaps also see the XML generation facilities in the XML package.
