<p>
<b>1.  Can CGIwithR be used with a web server running under Microsoft Windows?</b>  The short answer is no.  The longer answer is probably yes, provided that the web server supports CGI, and that standard unix tools (including <i>bash</i>) are installed, e.g., from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>. Probably some tweaking of the <i>R.cgi</i> shell script will also be needed.  

<br>
<b>News</b> March 2004: Adam Lyon kindly emailed me to say he has succeeded in getting CGIwithR to work under Windows.  The details are in file <i>windows.txt</i>.<br>
<b>News</b> Oct 2004: File <i>windows.txt</i> is updated to include some further helpful advice from Kurt Sys.<br>
<b>News</b> Sep 2005: File <a href="windows.txt">windows.txt</a> is updated to include yet more helpful advice from Carlos Rendon.

<b>2.  When trying to use CGIwithR, for example with the <i>trivial.R</i> example, I get no response from the webserver and this error message in the httpd log file:
<pre>
    Premature end of script headers: /usr/var/cgi-bin/R.cgi
</pre>
Why?</b>  Almost certainly this is because one or more of <i>R.cgi</i>, <i>.Rprofile</i> and <i>trivial.R</i> has been put in the wrong place on your system.


</p>
<p>
<b>3.  I have recently updated R and now my CGIwithR scripts don't work any more.  I have checked that my installed CGIwithR package is the latest version.  Any clues?</b>  Did you perhaps forget to install the new R.cgi file?  This comes inside the inst subdirectory of the CGIwithR package, and it needs to be installed in your "cgi-bin" (or whatever it's called on your system) directory.
